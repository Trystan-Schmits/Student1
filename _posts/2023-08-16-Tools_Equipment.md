## tool setup ##

>I setup a virtual machine for my chromebook. The virtual machine came with vscode, but I had to follow instructions to install the up to date versions of python, jupyter notebooks, and ruby.

>Now; I can edit my site, and create a local version of the website with my changes.

>finally I set my website up to sync with github for easier access from different devices.
